                    what the server will see this form's name as, and the type is usually given by context, the
                    autocomplete attribute expects on/off as its value, but turning it on, it will remember the
                    other inputs that have been entered into this field and suggest those if the user fills the form
                    out once and then again later. The required attribute is a true/false attribute, but we do not have
                    to set it equal to anything since it is true by default. Only a single element in the page may have
                    autofocus because more than a single element cannot be focused, when the page loads the focus will
                    be on the input of the form, thus giving it a blue highlight when selected-->
                </p> <!-- Using p gives a line break with space between the inputs, but using div looks nicer with
                no space between the inputs as a form usually is like-->
